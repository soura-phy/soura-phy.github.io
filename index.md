description: Undergraduate at Indian Institute of Science
---


I am a 5th-year undergraduate at Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru, with a broad interest in Physics. I am pursuing the <a href='https://bs-ug.iisc.ac.in/'>BS-MS program</a> at the IISc.

I joined the IISc in 2020 after completing 12th grade. My primary interest is in astrophysics, especially astroparticle physics and cosmology. I have taken undergraduate and graduate-level courses in astrophysics, cosmology, and high-energy physics. Besides, I have been involved in astroparticle physics and cosmology research for the last two years.

My first project at IISc was on transitions in dimers, which introduced me to practical uses of quantum mechanics. Following this, I started working on general relativity through a reading project. In May 2023, I went to the Australian National University to work on my first astrophysics project, funded by the ANU's Future Research Talent program. I worked at the Mount Stromlo Observatory for three months and did a research project on positron annihilation in the interstellar medium, in the search for a dark matter origin of these positrons. Thereafter, I started working on early-Universe cosmology at IISc, specifically on the epoch of 'inflation' when the Universe expanded exponentially within a short time. This was the topic my bachelor's dissertation at IISc. In 2024, I started working on a project that aims at obtaining constraints on the interactions of dark matter with ordinary matter using the farthest galaxies observed in the Universe. In the meanwhile, I have also been working on tools for teaching basic mathematical physics using a bunch of tools in Mathematica, and have co-authored a journal article (See [Publications](publications)) on group theory and its physical applications using the same.
