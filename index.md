description: Undergraduate at Indian Institute of Science
---


I am a 5th-year undergraduate at Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru, with a broad interest in Physics. I am pursuing the BS-MS program at the IISc. More details on the program can be found <a href='https://bs-ug.iisc.ac.in/'>here</a>.

I joined the IISc in 2020 after completing 12th grade.

My first project at IISc was on transitions in dimers, which introduced me to practical uses of quantum mechanics. I then started working on general relativity with a reading project. Following this, I went to the Australian National University to work on my first astrophysics project, funded by the ANU's Future Research Talent program. I worked at the Mount Stromlo Observatory for three months and worked on positron annihilation in the interstellar medium, which can tell us a lot about dark matter. Thereafter, I started working on early Universe cosmology at IISc, specifically involving the epoch of 'inflation' when the Universe expanded exponentially fast. This formed my bachelor's dissertation at IISc. In 2024, I started another project that explores interactions of dark matter with ordinary matter using the farthest observed galaxies in the Universe. In the meanwhile, I have also been working on tools for teaching basic mathematical physics using a bunch of tools in Mathematica, and have co-authored a journal article on group theory and its physical applications using the same.
