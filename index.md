description: Undergraduate at Indian Institute of Science

I am a 5th-year undergraduate at Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru, with a broad interest in theoretical and computational physics. I mainly work on high-energy astrophysics/astro-particle physics. I like computing stuff, as it makes the raw equations come into life in front of my eyes. Solving equations on a computer often motivates me to learn new physics concepts.
