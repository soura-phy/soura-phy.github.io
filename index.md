<h2>About myself</h2>

I am a first-year PhD student at the Ohio State University. I work on theoretical astrophysics, cosmology and astroparticle physics. I joined the PhD program at OSU Department of Physics, starting August 2025.

I completed my undergraduate and master's studies at Indian Institute of Science in Bengaluru, India. I graduated with BS and MS degree in 2025, with a major in Physics. My primary interest is in astrophysics, especially astroparticle physics and cosmology. I have taken undergraduate and graduate-level courses in astrophysics, cosmology, and high-energy physics. Besides, I have been involved in astroparticle physics and cosmology research for the last two years. 

<h2>What I work on</h2>

My first project at IISc was on transitions in dimers, which introduced me to practical uses of quantum mechanics. Following this, I started working on general relativity through a reading project. In May 2023, I went to the Australian National University to work on my first astrophysics project, funded by the ANU's Future Research Talent program. I worked at the Mount Stromlo Observatory for three months and did a research project on positron annihilation in the interstellar medium, in the search for a dark matter origin of these positrons. Thereafter, I started working on early-Universe cosmology at IISc, specifically on the epoch of 'inflation' when the Universe expanded exponentially within a short time. This was the topic my bachelor's dissertation at IISc. In 2024, I started working on a project that aims at obtaining constraints on the interactions of dark matter with ordinary matter using the farthest galaxies observed in the Universe. In the meanwhile, I have also been working on tools for teaching basic mathematical physics using a bunch of tools in Mathematica, and have co-authored a journal article (See [Publications](publications)) on group theory and its physical applications using the same.
