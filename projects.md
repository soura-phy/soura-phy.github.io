## Academic Projects

<dl>


<dt> <a href="projects/dm-baryon.html">Probing Dark Matter - Standard Model Interactions using JWST Observations of Early Galaxies</a></dt>

  <dd> <i>Supervisor:</i> <b>Prof. Ranjan Laha</b><br> Center for High Energy Physics, Indian Institute of Science.</dd>
  <dd> <i>Duration:</i> August 2024 to present</dd>
  <dd> <i>Overview:</i> Understanding the nature of dark matter is one of the greatest unsolved mysteries in all of physics. In this project, we looked at dark matter interactions with Standard Model particles, which can potentially decrease the number density of galaxies at high redshifts, in the early stages of the Universe. We use the non-observation of such effects in high-redshift galaxy data from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to put upper bounds on the interaction strength between dark matter and ordinary matter. <a href="projects/dm-baryon.html">[Read more...]</a> </dd>
  

<dt> <a href="projects/positrons.html">Dark matter decay and Positron annihilation in the Interstellar Medium</a></dt>

  <dd> <i> Supervisors:</i> <b>Prof. Mark Krumholz</b> and <b>Prof. Roland Crocker</b><br> Research School of Astronomy and Astrophysics, Australian National University.</dd>
  <dd> <i>Duration:</i> May 2023 to July 2023</dd>
  <dd> <i>Overview:</i> The 511 keV line in the inner regions of the Milky Way, produced by annihilation of positrons with electrons, stands an unsolved problem for the last 50 years. Explaining the shape of the emission region and the amount of emission simulaneously has evaded many astrophysical models and exotic scenarios, given strong upper limits on the energy of these positrons. In this work, we revisit these upper limits and put conservative constraints that relax the existing limits, based on new gamma-ray data and cosmic ray propagation models. <a href="projects/positrons.html">[Read more...]</a></dd>
