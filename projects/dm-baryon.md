## Pretext

[Dark matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter) is a hypothesized form of matter that is essential to our understanding of the Universe. Rotation velocities of stars in galaxies, motion of gas in galaxy clusters, and the existence of structures as we see on large scales, all require the existence of some form of matter beyond what we can 'see'. This form of matter, called 'dark matter', has no conclusive evidence yet. However, numerous experiments all across the globe are working to probe the properties of dark matter through astrophysical observations (also called [indirect detection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indirect_detection_of_dark_matter) experiments), [direct detection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_detection_of_dark_matter) experiments involving dark matter potentially scattering with a solid material, or in the form unaccounted energy losses in particle [colliders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter#Collider_searches_for_dark_matter). 

While none of these experiments have revealed a solid evidence for dark matter, we know how crucial dark matter is to our own existence. In fact, galaxies such as our Milky Way would not have formed in the first place if dark matter was not there to hold the matter together. Similarly, recent observations using some of the most powerful telescopes, for example the James Webb Space Telescope that was laucnhed back in 2021, have found numerous galaxies in the very, very distant Universe. These galaxies are so far away from us that the light from them takes billions of years to reach our telescopes. This means that many of these galaxies were formed when the Universe was a few hundred million years old, which is just 2% of its current age, 14 billion years. The existence and characterization of these galaxies is a great test of dark matter properties. This is the general principle that forms the backbone of this project.

## Cosmology

Why is dark matter crucial to the existence of galaxies? First of all, recall what galaxies essentially are. They are regions of space that are denser as compared to the background Universe. For comparison, the density of ordinary matter in the plane of our Galaxy is nearly 1 proton per cubic centimeter, while that in the background Universe is roughly 1 per every cubic meter. A difference of 6 orders of magnitude! On the other hand, we have an idea of how large these difference was in the early Universe - from the [Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background) radiation. The tiny fluctuations that we see in this radiation field, produced when the Universe was just a few hundred thousand years old, are incredibly small - 1 part in $10^5$. Going from these almost inconceivable fluctuations to the variety of dense structures like galaxies is what has motivated cosmologists to come up with a theory of structure formation. In this theory, these tiny over-densities produced in the early Universe undergo a process of 'gravitational collapse' - they crumble under their own gravity to form what we call galaxies.

Where does dark matter come into all of this? As it turns out, ordinary matter interacts with radiation (such as electromagnetic radiation of different frequencies) and faces a [radiation pressure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_pressure). This pressure tends to prevent collapse into denser structures. On the other hand, if we include in our theory of structure formation a form of matter devoid of pressure, we increase the strength of gravity without adding extra pressure. Then we can proceed happily with collapsing these minute overdensities into something cosmologists call 'halos' of matter. The visible part of our Milky Way Galaxy (and other galaxies we have seen) sits near the center of a larger halo of dark matter. This theory of gravitational collapse and growth of structures is highly successful in reproducing observations of the Universe at the largest length scales.
